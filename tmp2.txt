For an Engineering Science Master's degree student, applicable scholarships include both financial aid programs focused specifically on engineering fields and general graduate scholarships that support various disciplines within the university setting. Considering the information available without using 'Read website content,' these opportunities may be relevant:

1. Cycle Graduate Scholarships - As this is a cyclical fund, it's essential to check their specific eligibility criteria for engineering students, which typically involves academic excellence and leadership potential within the field of study. The application deadline is generally around March 31st; however, you should verify on the official website or contact directly due to possible changes in scheduling.

2. Norman S. Baldwin Fishery Science Scholarship - Although this scholarship focuses on fisheries science, students with a strong interest in environmental engineering and related disciplines may find it appealing if they align their studies accordingly. The deadline is January 12th, and the scholarship amount of $3,000 can significantly support graduate study expenses.

3. Parents' Need Scholarships ($1,000) - This open-ended scholarship may be available to students whose parents are facing financial difficulties. While it doesn't directly target engineering fields, this opportunity could provide crucial assistance for pursuing a master's degree in any discipline, including Engineering Science.

4. Pretty Presets Scholarship ($500) - This scholarship provides educational grants which may be used to support graduate studies and can benefit students with an engineering focus if they are part of the recipient program or institution (e.g., Rank-it College). The deadline is April 15th, 2025.

In addition to these opportunities, it's advisable for prospective Engineering Science Master's degree students to also explore specific scholarships such as those offered by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), National Association of Graduate-Professional Students (NCGPS), and industry partnerships like ExxonMobil. These organizations often provide substantial financial support specifically tailored for women in engineering, graduate students, or students who have demonstrated potential to contribute significantly to their chosen field upon completion of their master's degree.

Consult the respective scholarship websites for up-to-date information on eligibility requirements, application deadlines, and submission guidelines to maximize your chances of securing financial aid through these various opportunities.
